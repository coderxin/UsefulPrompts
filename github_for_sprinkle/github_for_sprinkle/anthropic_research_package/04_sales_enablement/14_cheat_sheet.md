## PAGE 1: CORE INTEL

### 🎯 YOUR 10-SECOND PITCH (MEMORIZE COLD)

**Safety-Focused** (For Dario, Jared, Safety Team):
"We extend Claude's Constitutional AI safety from the model layer to the deployment layer, providing enterprises with transparent audit trails and interpretable governance that maintains Anthropic's safety standards while enabling adoption in FDA, SEC, and other highly regulated environments."

**Enterprise-Focused** (For Daniela, Business Teams):
"We accelerate Claude's adoption in enterprises with complex compliance needs—financial services, life sciences, government—by providing the deployment governance infrastructure that makes Constitutional AI work in FDA, SEC, and FedRAMP environments without requiring Anthropic's Applied AI team to become regulatory experts in every vertical."

**Technical-Focused** (For Tom, Sam, Engineering):
"We've built deployment architecture that applies scaling law principles to governance—as Claude usage scales from hundreds to hundreds of thousands of queries, safety properties scale predictably following power law behavior, not linear overhead. MCP-native with Constitutional AI principle validation at the deployment layer, providing O(1) governance overhead through federated architecture."

---

### 💡 YOUR 3 KEY TALKING POINTS

1. **Constitutional AI Deployment Infrastructure**: We operationalize Anthropic's Constitutional AI principles at the deployment layer—connecting model-level safety to regulatory compliance (FDA 21 CFR Part 11, SEC SR 11-7, GDPR Article 22).

2. **3 Weeks vs 9 Months**: Pre-validated governance frameworks reduce enterprise deployment approval from 9+ months of custom development to 3-week implementation with proven regulatory validation.

3. **Applied AI Leverage**: Each AI engineer supports 15 enterprise deployments instead of 4 when governance is productized rather than custom-built for every customer.
