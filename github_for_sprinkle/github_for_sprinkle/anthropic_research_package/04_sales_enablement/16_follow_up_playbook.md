# ANTHROPIC ENGAGEMENT - FOLLOW-UP PLAYBOOK

**Purpose**: Multi-touch engagement strategy post-initial contact with Anthropic

**Philosophy**: Persistence with value, not annoyance. Anthropic values substance over frequency—every touch should provide genuine value aligned with their mission.

---

## FOLLOW-UP PHILOSOPHY FOR ANTHROPIC

### Core Principles

**1. Value-First, Always**
- Every touch provides value (insight, research, introduction, relevant content)
- Never "just checking in" or "circling back" without substance
- Think: "What can I give them?" not "What can I get from them?"

**2. Evidence-Based Communication**
- Reference specific conversation points (proves you listened)
- Use data, customer examples, research findings (not generic claims)
- Cite sources, be transparent about limitations

**3. Respect Their Time & Culture**
- Concise emails (3-5 paragraphs maximum, scannable format)
- Long-term thinking (relationships measured in months/years, not days/weeks)
- Thoughtful, not transactional (mission-driven language, not quota-driven)

**4. Intellectual Honesty**
- Acknowledge when timing isn't right (give permission to defer)
- Admit what you don't know (builds trust)
- Transparent about your interests while aligning with theirs

**5. Multi-Touch Relationship Building**
- Plan 6-12 month relationship development (not single email → sales call)
- Vary touch types (email, LinkedIn, content sharing, introductions, events)
- Stay relevant to their current initiatives (requires ongoing research)

## FOLLOW-UP TIMELINE & CADENCE

### 📅 Day 1 (Within 24 Hours) - CRITICAL

**Action**: Initial follow-up email

**Template**:
```
Subject: Great meeting you at [event] - Constitutional AI deployment

[Name],

Thank you for the conversation about [specific topic you discussed]. I was particularly struck by your point about [something specific they said]—that aligns exactly with what we're seeing in [relevant context].

As we discussed, [your value proposition in one sentence tailored to their priority]. I've attached [promised material] that shows [specific evidence relevant to their interest]:

- [Attachment 1]: [What it is and why relevant to their stated priority]
- [Attachment 2]: [What it is and why relevant to their challenge]

Given your focus on [their priority you learned], I thought you might find [specific resource/insight] valuable: [link or brief summary]

[IF next step was agreed]:
Per our conversation, would [specific day/time next week] work for a 20-minute call to explore [specific topic they showed interest in]? I'm available [specific time options].

[IF next step was not defined]:
No immediate action needed from you. I'll [what you promised to do]. In the meantime, if questions come up or you'd like to connect sooner, I'm at [email/phone].

Thanks again for the insightful conversation. What Anthropic is building with Constitutional AI is genuinely important work.

Best,
[Your name]
[Title]
[Email]
[LinkedIn]
```

**Key Elements**:
- Reference specific conversation details (not generic "nice to meet you")
- Provide value immediately (relevant attachment, insight, resource)
- Clear next step if discussed, low-pressure if not
- Genuine appreciation for their mission (not fake flattery)

**Parallel Actions**:
- [ ] Send calendar invite if meeting scheduled (include agenda)
- [ ] LinkedIn connection request with personalized note
- [ ] Add to CRM with detailed conversation notes
- [ ] Calendar reminder for Day 3 follow-up (if no response)

---

### 📅 Day 3-4 (If No Response to Day 1)

**Action**: LinkedIn engagement OR value-add touch (soft, not pushy)

**Option A - LinkedIn Engagement**:
- Like/comment thoughtfully on their recent post (genuine insight, not salesy)
- Share their content with added commentary (amplify their thought leadership)
- Engage with Anthropic company posts (show ongoing interest in their mission)

**Option B - Email Value-Add** (No ask):
```
Subject: Thought you'd find this relevant - [topic]

[Name],

Saw this [report/article/research finding] on [topic you discussed] and immediately thought of our conversation about [their specific challenge]:

[2-3 sentence summary of key insight that's relevant to them]

[Link to resource]

Thought you might find it valuable given your work on [their initiative].

Hope the [Life Sciences / Financial Services / MCP] expansion is progressing well!

[Your name]
```

**What to Share** (Anthropic-Relevant):
- AI safety research papers (model interpretability, alignment, Constitutional AI advances)
- Regulatory updates (EU AI Act, SB 53 implementation, FDA AI guidelines, SEC algorithmic trading rules)
- Enterprise AI adoption studies (McKinsey, Gartner, industry-specific research)
- Competitive intelligence (OpenAI, Google Gemini developments they should know)
- Customer success stories from their target verticals (pharma, fintech, government)

**What NOT to Share**:
- Your company blog posts (self-serving)
- Generic "thought leadership" (no clear relevance)
- Competitor attack pieces (not their culture)
- Anything not directly relevant to their stated priorities

---

### 📅 Day 7 (If Still No Response - Third Touch)

**Action**: Different angle - not "just checking in"

**Template**:
```
Subject: [Their company] + [specific capability] question

[Name],

Quick question - do you know who at Anthropic handles [adjacent area you could help with]?

Reason I ask: After our conversation about [topic], got me thinking about how Constitutional AI deployment governance could also help with [different but related use case - e.g., "MCP ecosystem security patterns" or "international regulatory frameworks for global expansion"].

If it's you, great - happy to share some initial thinking. If not, who would be the right person to connect with?

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

**Why This Works**:
- Asks for introduction (different from sales pitch)
- Shows you're thinking about their problems beyond initial conversation
- Low commitment ask (just a connection)
- Demonstrates continued relevance

---

### 📅 Day 14 (If Still No Response - Final Direct Attempt)

**Action**: "Breakup email" - often gets response when nothing else has

**Template**:
```
Subject: Closing the loop - Constitutional AI governance

[Name],

Haven't heard back, so I'm guessing Constitutional AI deployment infrastructure isn't a priority right now—totally understand.

I'll stop reaching out, but if [triggering event - e.g., "FDA or SEC regulatory requirements become blockers for Life Sciences/Financial Services customers", "Applied AI team capacity constraints create deployment bottlenecks"] happens, or you want to revisit down the road, feel free to ping me.

Best of luck with [their specific initiative - Life Sciences launch, MCP ecosystem, global expansion, etc.]! Your work on Constitutional AI safety is genuinely important.

[Your name]
```

**Psychology**: Permission to stop often triggers "No wait, let's talk" response. If it doesn't, they genuinely weren't interested—move to long-term nurture.

- Be vague about next steps (propose specific actions, not "let's chat sometime")

---

### Template 2: Send-Info Response (After "Send Me Information" Request)

**FIRST: Qualify Before Sending** (Critical - Don't Blindly Send Everything)

**Subject**: Following up - which aspect of Constitutional AI governance matters most?

**Body**:
```
[Name],

Absolutely happy to send relevant information.

To make sure I send what's most useful (and you don't get overwhelmed with materials), can I ask what you're most interested in:

1. **Technical approach** - How Constitutional AI deployment governance works with Claude/MCP at architecture level
2. **Business case** - ROI and deployment models for [their vertical - Life Sciences / Financial Services / etc.]
3. **Regulatory validation** - FDA 21 CFR Part 11 / SEC SR 11-7 compliance frameworks and proof points
4. **Integration specifics** - How we fit with your Applied AI team and enterprise customer deployments

Or is there a specific use case or challenge you're thinking about?

I want to send signal, not noise.

[Your name]
```

**THEN: Send Targeted Follow-Up Based on Response**

**Subject**: As requested - [specific topic they indicated]

**Body**:
```
[Name],

Following up on your interest in [specific topic from their response].

Here's what I think will be most relevant:

**1. [Specific Resource 1]**: [What it is and why relevant]
   - Key takeaway: [Specific insight addressing their interest]
   - [Attach or link]

**2. [Specific Resource 2]**: [What it is and why relevant]

   - [Attach or link]

**3. [Optional Resource 3]**: [What it is and why relevant]
   - [Attach or link only if highly relevant]

Based on your focus on [their priority], I'd particularly draw your attention to [specific section/finding]. You'll see how [connection to their needs].

Would it make sense to schedule 15-20 minutes next week to answer any questions that come up? I'm available [specific times], but no pressure—also happy to discuss async over email if that's easier.

[Your name]
```

**When to Use**: After they request information (ALWAYS qualify first—don't assume what they want).

**What to Send** (Based on What They Asked For):
- **If business-focused**: One-page executive summary + ROI case study + customer testimonial
- **If technical**: Architecture diagram + MCP integration guide + technical specification
- **If regulatory**: FDA/SEC compliance framework + audit pass rate data + regulatory validation process
- **If skeptical**: Customer reference offer + pilot proposal + risk mitigation framework

**Pro Tip**: Qualifying BEFORE sending gets much higher engagement than blindly sending deck.

---

### Template 3: Demo/Meeting Request (After Qualified Interest)

**Subject**: [Their priority] + Constitutional AI governance demo - [timeframe]

**Body**:
```
[Name],

Based on our conversation about [specific challenge they mentioned], I think a brief demo would be valuable to show how Constitutional AI deployment governance addresses [specific aspect].

Specifically, I'd walk through:

1. **[Capability 1 relevant to them]** (5 min) - How we [solve their specific pain point]
2. **[Capability 2 relevant to them]** (5 min) - Integration with Claude/MCP for [their use case]
3. **[Capability 3 relevant to them]** (5 min) - [Regulatory framework / ROI model / technical architecture] for [their context]
4. **Q&A on your specific situation** (10 min)

Total time: 25 minutes

Would [specific date/time option 1] or [specific date/time option 2] work for you? [If senior executive: Happy to record it if you'd prefer to review async instead of live.]

Looking forward to showing how [specific outcome relevant to their stated priority].

Best,
[Your name]
```

**When to Use**: After they've shown genuine interest and engagement (not after first touch).

**Demo Best Practices for Anthropic**:
- Start with THEIR use case, not your features (customer-centric, not product-centric)
- Show Constitutional AI alignment/safety elements (emphasize methodology match)
- Be ready for deep technical questions (they're sophisticated, don't oversimplify)
- Have data and evidence ready (they value proof points, not claims)
- Show, don't just tell (live demo > slides whenever possible)
- Acknowledge limitations honestly (builds trust, matches their intellectual honesty culture)

---

### Template 4: Warm Introduction Request

**Subject**: Introduction to [Target Person] at Anthropic?

**Body**:
```
[Connector Name],

Thank you for connecting me with [Person] at Anthropic—the conversation about [topic] was incredibly valuable and [specific insight you gained].

During our discussion, [specific need or opportunity identified] came up that seems relevant to [Target Person's] work on [their area based on your research].

Would you be comfortable making an introduction? I think [Target Person] would find [specific value or insight you can provide] relevant to [their priority you researched].

No worries if not—I genuinely appreciate the initial connection regardless.

If helpful, here's suggested intro language (feel free to edit):

"[Target Person], thought you'd find this relevant given your work on [their focus]. [Your name] and I were discussing [topic], and [specific insight] came up that connects to [their priority]. Worth a conversation if you're interested."

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

**When to Use**: After successful initial conversation, when there's clear value for the new person (not just for you).

**Pro Tips**:
- Make it EASY for connector (draft the intro language for them)
- Specific value for person being introduced to (not vague networking)
- Clear relevance (not just "would be good to connect")
- Respect if they decline (protects their social capital)

**What Makes It Work**:
- Explicit value for the target person (what's in it for them?)
- Low effort for connector (you wrote the intro for them)
- Clear purpose (not vague "pick your brain" networking)
- Respect for relationships (acknowledges they're using social capital)

---

### Template 5: Re-Engagement After Silence (2-3 Weeks No Response)

**Subject**: Quick question about [their current initiative]

**Body**:
```
[Name],

I know you're incredibly busy with [current initiative - Life Sciences expansion / MCP ecosystem / global scaling / etc.].

Quick question: As you expand Claude into [vertical / use case], are you seeing [specific challenge you solve]?

We've helped [similar company/vertical] solve this by [specific approach], and thought it might be relevant given [their priority].

If timing isn't right, totally understand. Would love to stay connected as [their initiative] progresses—your work on Constitutional AI is genuinely fascinating.

[Your name]
```

**When to Use**: 2-3 weeks after initial contact with no response (not after every email—space it out).

- Recent Anthropic news (product launches, partnerships, funding)
- Their LinkedIn activity (posts, comments, thought leadership)
- Industry trends affecting their priorities (regulations, competitive moves)
- Adjacent opportunities (new use case, different vertical, emerging need)

### Template 7: Event-Based Touch (Their News/Achievement)

**Subject**: Congrats on [recent announcement]!

**Body**:
```
[Name],

Saw the announcement about [their recent news - funding / product launch / partnership / expansion / award / research publication]. Congratulations to you and the team!

[Specific insight about what this means - not generic]: This [validates your approach to / enables you to / positions you for] [strategic implication you understand from your research].

[IF relevant to your offering - light touch, not heavy-handed]:
As you [scale this initiative / deploy this capability / expand into these markets], [one sentence about how you might help—framed as observation, not pitch]. But either way, really exciting progress.

Looking forward to seeing what Anthropic achieves with Constitutional AI. The mission matters.

Best,
[Your name]
```

**When to Use**: When they have significant news (funding, product launch, major customer win, partnership, awards, key hire, research publication).

**Pro Tips**:
- **Set Google Alerts** for "Anthropic" to catch news quickly (timing matters—congrats is best within 24-48 hours)
- **Be genuinely congratulatory** (not just using news as excuse to reach out—they can tell the difference)
- **Show strategic understanding** (not just "congrats"—demonstrate what this news means for their trajectory)
- **Subtle connection to your value** (if natural and relevant, mention how you could support—but don't make that the focus)
- **Relationship focus** (emphasize you're following their progress because you care about the mission, not just the sale)

**What News to React To**:
- Funding announcements (Series F, strategic investments)
- Product launches (Claude updates, vertical solutions, MCP developments)
- Partnerships (Google Cloud, AWS, enterprise customers)
- Key hires (especially C-suite, VPs, research leadership)
- Research publications (papers on Constitutional AI, safety, alignment)
- Awards or recognition (Time 100, industry accolades)
- Regulatory wins (policy endorsements they support)
- Market share gains or competitive achievements

## MULTI-TOUCH RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT PLAN

### The 6-Month Partnership Cultivation Strategy

**Philosophy**: Anthropic makes strategic decisions over months, not days. This is a marathon, not a sprint. Build relationship equity before asking for anything significant.

---

**Month 1: Establish Foundation**

**Week 1**:
- Day 1: Post-meeting thank you [Template 1]
- Day 3: LinkedIn connection + engagement on their content
- Day 7: Value-add touch [Template 6] - share relevant research

**Week 2-4**:
- Check-in on next step if one was defined
- OR Re-engagement if no response [Template 5]
- Engage authentically with their LinkedIn content (thoughtful comments, not just likes)

**Goal**: Establish you as thoughtful, knowledgeable, genuinely interested in their mission.

---

**Month 2: Deepen Credibility**

**Week 5-6**:
- Share substantial value (customer case study from their vertical, regulatory research relevant to their expansion)
- Introduce them to valuable connection (if you can genuinely help them)
- Engage with Import AI if Jack Clark is your contact (show you read his work)

**Week 7-8**:
- Event-based touch if relevant news [Template 7]
- OR Value-first touch with no ask [Template 6]
- Continue LinkedIn engagement (demonstrate ongoing attention to their work)

**Goal**: Position as valuable resource and knowledgeable partner, not just vendor.

---

**Month 3: Strategic Value Delivery**

**Week 9-10**:
- Deliver significant value (research collaboration opportunity, introduction to key customer, unique market insight)
- Share customer success story highly relevant to their vertical expansion
- Propose low-commitment collaboration (research partnership, pilot, design partner)

**Week 11-12**:
- Follow up on any collaborative opportunities discussed
- Check if priorities have shifted (requires asking, not assuming)
- Value-add touch specific to their current initiative

**Goal**: Demonstrate you can contribute to their strategic priorities, not just sell to them.

---

**Month 4: Strategic Re-Engagement**

**Week 13-14**:
- Share new development on your side that's relevant to them (major customer win in their vertical, product evolution, research partnership)
- Offer to share learnings from recent deployments in FDA/SEC contexts
- Propose strategic conversation (not sales pitch—exploratory discussion of mutual opportunity)

**Week 15-16**:
- Event-based touch if relevant [Template 7]
- Continue LinkedIn engagement and thought leadership interaction
- Check on timing for deeper conversation

**Goal**: Elevate from tactical to strategic discussion level.

---

**Month 5: Partnership Exploration**

**Week 17-18**:
- Propose substantive meeting (demo, technical deep-dive, strategic discussion) [Template 3]
- Share partnership framework ideas (how you might work together, not just what you sell)
- Involve your senior leadership if appropriate (show seriousness of intent)

**Week 19-20**:
- Execute on meeting if scheduled
- OR Continue value-add touches if timing still not right
- Begin discussing partnership structure (not just vendor transaction)

**Goal**: Move from relationship building to partnership exploration.

---

**Month 6: Partnership Definition or Long-Term Nurture**

**Week 21-22**:
- If partnership progressing: Define pilot, POC, or strategic collaboration
- If timing still not right: Move to quarterly touch cadence (recognize long sales cycle)
- Maintain relationship regardless (this could be 12-18 month cycle for strategic partnerships)

**Week 23-24**:
- Confirm next steps (specific actions, timelines, success criteria)
- OR Plan long-term nurture strategy (quarterly touches, ongoing value delivery)
- Continue being valuable resource regardless of immediate opportunity

**Goal**: Either advance to partnership OR establish long-term relationship for future opportunity.

---

### Ongoing (Months 7-12+): Quarterly Strategic Touches

**If No Immediate Opportunity**:
- **Q3**: Substantial value delivery (research findings, customer insights, industry analysis)
- **Q4**: Check if priorities shifted, share year-end insights
- **Q1 (Year 2)**: New year strategic touch, relevant market trends
- **Q2 (Year 2)**: Re-assess timing and fit based on their evolution

**If Opportunity in Progress**:
- Continue engagement cadence appropriate to partnership stage
- Regular value delivery aligned with their evaluation process
- Maintain relationship with all stakeholders (not just champion)

---

## FOLLOW-UP TRACKING & MEASUREMENT

### Metrics to Track (CRM or Spreadsheet)

**For Each Contact**:
- Name, title, email, LinkedIn, phone
- Date of each touch (email, LinkedIn, meeting, call)
- Topic of each interaction
- Their response (engaged / neutral / no response)
- Their stated priorities (update as they share more)
- Next touch date (when to follow up)
- Relationship temperature (cold / warm / hot)
- Stage (awareness / interest / evaluation / partnership)
- Notes from each interaction (specific quotes, insights, commitments)

---

### Success Metrics by Timeline

**Immediate Success** (Within 2 weeks):
- [ ] Email response rate (40-60% is good for warm leads)
- [ ] Meeting scheduled
- [ ] Materials requested
- [ ] LinkedIn connection accepted
- [ ] They initiated contact (responded without your prompt)

**Short-Term Success** (Within 2 months):
- [ ] Demo completed or technical deep-dive scheduled
- [ ] Introduction to additional team members
- [ ] Ongoing dialogue (multiple back-and-forth exchanges)
- [ ] They share substantive information about their challenges
- [ ] They reference you in their internal discussions

**Medium-Term Success** (Within 6 months):
- [ ] Partnership discussion initiated
- [ ] Pilot or POC proposed/started
- [ ] Strategic evaluation underway
- [ ] Multiple stakeholder engagement
- [ ] Mutual value creation being explored

**Long-Term Success** (Ongoing relationship quality):
- [ ] They respond consistently to your outreach
- [ ] They share information proactively with you
- [ ] They introduce you to others in their network
- [ ] They think of you when opportunities arise
- [ ] They become advocates for your approach

---

### When to Adjust Cadence

**Increase Frequency If**:
- They're responding positively and engaging
- Specific opportunity is progressing
- They've requested ongoing communication
- Time-sensitive evaluation or decision in progress

**Decrease Frequency If**:
- Multiple touches with no response (after 3-4 attempts, space out significantly)
- They explicitly ask for less frequent contact
- Timing clearly isn't right (respect their signal)
- You're providing value but no immediate opportunity (shift to quarterly)

**Stop Completely If**:
- They explicitly say "not interested" (respect their decision)
- Unsubscribe request or ask to be removed (immediate compliance)
- Legal or compliance concerns (never push past boundaries)
- Clear misalignment that won't change (recognize it's not a fit)

---

## WHAT TO DO WHEN...

### ...They Don't Respond to Follow-Up

**After 1st Email** (Wait 3-4 days):
- Send 2nd email with different value angle [Template 5]
- Not "just checking in"—provide new insight or ask different question

**After 2nd Email** (Wait 1 week):
- Switch to LinkedIn engagement (like/comment on their post)
- OR Send value-first touch with no ask [Template 6]

**After 3rd Touch** (Wait 2-3 weeks):
- Send event-based touch if relevant news [Template 7]
- OR Consider "breakup email" [Day 14 template above]

**After 4-5 Touches Over 6-8 Weeks** (With zero engagement):
- Move to quarterly cadence (they're not interested right now)
- Continue to provide value without expectation
- Check annually if circumstances changed

**When to Stop**: If after 4-5 touches over 2-3 months there's zero engagement, they're not interested. Move to annual touch or remove from active outreach.

---

### ...They Ask for Pricing

**DON'T**: Send pricing in email without context

**DO**: Use as opportunity for conversation

**Response**:
```
Great question. Pricing varies based on [deployment model / scale / regulatory frameworks needed].

Before I share specifics, would it make sense to schedule 20 minutes to understand your requirements? That way I can provide relevant pricing for your situation, not just our full menu.

Are you available [specific times]?

If you need ballpark before we talk: customers similar to Anthropic's enterprise scale typically land in $180K-$420K annually, but that depends on [deployment volume / number of regulated environments / integration complexity].
```

**If They Insist on Email**:
- Provide range, not specific number (without requirements, precision is false)
- Frame in terms of value and ROI (what they get, not just what it costs)
- Lead with typical customer outcomes (3-5x ROI in 6 months because...)
- Compare to current costs (governance development = 4-6 FTEs = $800K-$1.2M annually)
- Propose call to discuss specific fit (don't let pricing discussion happen entirely async)

---

### ...They Want to Introduce You to Someone

**DO IMMEDIATELY**:

1. **Thank them profusely** (they're using social capital for you)

2. **Provide context for the introduction** (make it easy):
```
Thank you for offering to introduce me to [Person]. Here's context that might be helpful:

### ...They Say "Not Right Now"

**DO**:
- Acknowledge and respect timing (don't push)
- Ask clarifying questions (understand "when" or "what needs to change")
- Offer to stay in touch with low-touch value adds
- Plant seeds for future without pressure

**Response**:
```
Totally understand—timing is everything. Can I ask what would need to be true for this to become relevant?

And when should I check back in? Happy to share relevant insights in the meantime with no sales angle, or wait until [timeframe they suggest].

Either way, I'd love to stay connected. Your work on Constitutional AI is genuinely important.
```

**What You Learn**:
- Is it timing (budget cycle, other priorities first, resource constraints)?
- Is it fit (not relevant to their current roadmap)?
- Is it interest (polite brush-off vs genuine "not now")?

**Follow-Up Strategy**:
- Set calendar reminder for timeframe they mentioned (or 3-6 months if vague)
- Move to quarterly value-first touches (no asks)
- Check if triggering event occurs (funding, product launch, market shift)
- Build relationship equity before re-engaging on partnership

### ...They Forward You to Someone Else

**This is POSITIVE** (They're helping you find right person):

**DO**:
1. Thank the original contact
2. Reference them in outreach to new person
3. Keep original contact informed
4. Report back on outcome

**Email to New Person**:
```
[New Person],

[Original Contact] suggested I reach out to you regarding [topic].

Quick context: [Original Contact] and I discussed [topic], and they thought [specific reason you should talk] would be relevant to your work on [their area based on research].

[Brief 2-3 sentence value proposition tailored to new person's priorities]

Would 15-20 minutes make sense to explore whether [specific value] could be helpful for [their initiative]?

I'm available [specific times], or happy to work around your schedule.

Best,
[Your name]
```

**Why This Works**:
- Explicit warm introduction reference (social proof)
- Specific relevance to new person (not generic)
- Clear ask with easy yes/no (respect their time)
- Value-focused (what's in it for them)

## FINAL FOLLOW-UP PRINCIPLES

### The 7 Golden Rules

1. **Add Value First, Ask Second**
   - Every touch should give them something (insight, connection, resource)
   - "What can I provide?" before "What can I get?"

2. **Reference Specifics from Conversations**
   - Proves you listened, not just sending templates
   - Shows genuine engagement with their priorities

3. **Respect Their Time and Culture**
   - Concise emails (3-5 paragraphs maximum)
   - Evidence-based language (data, examples, research)
   - Thoughtful, not transactional (mission-driven framing)

4. **Think 6-12 Month Relationship**
   - Not single transaction or quick close
   - Strategic partnerships take time at Anthropic
   - Patience and consistency win over aggressive pursuit

5. **Be Okay with "No" or "Not Now"**
   - Long-term game (this quarter's "no" could be next year's "yes")
   - Respect their decision-making process and timing
   - Focus on relationship, not just opportunity

6. **Authenticity Over Persistence**
   - Genuine interest in their mission > frequent touches
   - Quality of engagement > quantity of emails
   - They can tell the difference between authentic and performative

7. **Make It About Them, Not You**
   - Their success, their priorities, their mission
   - Your value is in service of their goals
   - Partnership mindset, not vendor mindset

---

### The Meta-Goal

**Build a relationship where they WANT to hear from you** because you consistently provide value aligned with their mission.

If every touch makes them smarter, more successful, or better connected, you've won regardless of whether they become a customer immediately.

That's the foundation of strategic partnerships with mission-driven organizations like Anthropic.

---

**Remember**: Anthropic makes decisions deliberately, based on evidence, aligned with mission, over long time horizons. Your follow-up strategy should mirror their values: thoughtful, substantive, patient, evidence-based, mission-focused.

The best follow-up is the one they look forward to receiving.
