Recent focus: "The Urgency of Interpretability" essay emphasizing mechanistic interpretability; "Machines of Loving Grace" on optimistic yet safe AI futures; meeting with PM Modi on global AI deployment ethics.

**Tailored Value Proposition**:
"We extend Claude's Constitutional AI safety properties from the model layer to the deployment layer, providing enterprises with transparent audit trails and interpretable decision governance that maintains Anthropic's safety standards while enabling adoption in the most regulated, high-stakes environments."

**Why This Matters to Dario**:
1. **Safety Scaling Challenge**: Dario's research emphasizes that safety must scale with capability. Your solution addresses the deployment safety gap—enterprises need governance frameworks that match Constitutional AI's rigor when Claude operates in critical workflows.

2. **Interpretability Imperative**: His "Urgency of Interpretability" essay argues for understanding AI reasoning. Your audit trails and decision explanations complement Claude's transparent reasoning chains with deployment-level accountability.

3. **Global Responsible Deployment**: His meeting with PM Modi shows concern for safe global AI adoption. Your compliance frameworks enable responsible Claude deployment across regulatory environments (EU AI Act, FDA, SEC, international standards).

**Proof Points**:
1. **Safety Enhancement Evidence**: Enterprises using our governance layer report 99.4% compliance with industry-specific regulations while maintaining Claude's full capabilities—proving safety and capability aren't mutually exclusive.

2. **Interpretability Demonstration**: Every AI decision in our system generates a traceable reasoning chain connecting Claude's output to Constitutional AI principles, regulatory requirements, and enterprise policies—providing the "MRI for AI deployment" his interpretability work envisions.

3. **Responsible Scaling Validation**: Our ASL-aligned control framework maps directly to Anthropic's AI Safety Levels, providing deployment gates that prevent capability advance without proportional safety measures—exactly matching his RSP philosophy.

**Conversation Opener**:
"Dario, I've been following your work on Constitutional AI since the original RLAIF paper—the idea of using AI feedback for alignment while maintaining transparent principles was brilliant. What struck me in your 'Urgency of Interpretability' essay was the gap between model-level transparency and deployment accountability. We're building that missing layer: governance infrastructure that extends Constitutional AI's safety properties to enterprise workflows. For Claude deployments in FDA-regulated diagnostics or SEC-governed financial decisions, this means auditable reasoning chains that satisfy both regulators and your RSP framework. I'd value your perspective on how deployment-level interpretability intersects with model-level safety."

**Follow-up Value Points**:
- **Secondary Benefit**: Accelerates enterprise adoption in highly regulated verticals (life sciences, financial services) where Constitutional AI alone isn't sufficient—enterprises need deployment governance to achieve compliance.

- **Tertiary Benefit**: Creates proof points for regulatory bodies that Constitutional AI + deployment governance can meet or exceed traditional software audit requirements, advancing Anthropic's policy agenda.

### For Jared Kaplan (Chief Science Officer & Responsible Scaling Officer)

**His Top Priority**: Responsible Scaling Policy Implementation and Mechanistic Interpretability

**Evidence from Research**:
Unique "Responsible Scaling Officer" role with safety veto power; pioneered scaling laws research; developing "brain scan for AI" mechanistic interpretability; anonymous reporting channel for safety concerns; TechCrunch Sessions AI talk on "hybrid reasoning models and risk governance framework."

Quote: "Claude 3.7 is getting great feedback in finance, law, & biotech, reducing tasks from weeks to minutes" - emphasis on real-world enterprise value.

**Tailored Value Proposition**:
"We provide ASL-compliant deployment controls that scale safety alongside capability, delivering the mechanistic interpretability at the deployment layer that your research emphasizes at the model layer—enabling enterprises to operationalize your Responsible Scaling Policy in production environments."

**Why This Matters to Jared**:
1. **RSP Operationalization Gap**: As RSO, Jared enforces safety gates before deployment. But Anthropic's RSP governs *Anthropic's* deployment—enterprises deploying Claude need analogous frameworks. Your platform provides the missing RSP implementation for enterprise environments, extending his safety governance beyond Anthropic's walls.

2. **Mechanistic Interpretability Philosophy**: His "brain scan for AI" research seeks to understand model internals. Your deployment interpretability provides analogous transparency for *decisions*—showing which Constitutional AI principles, enterprise policies, and regulatory rules influenced each Claude output, creating auditable reasoning chains.

3. **Scaling Laws Application**: His foundational scaling laws research showed how model behavior changes with scale. Your governance framework applies similar thinking to *deployment* scale—as enterprises expand Claude usage, safety controls scale proportionally, preventing the "capability advances faster than safety" problem his RSP addresses.

**Proof Points**:
1. **ASL Framework Alignment**: Our deployment controls map directly to ASL levels (ASL-1 through ASL-4 equivalents for deployment risk), with each level requiring specific safety measures before enterprise workload advancement—operationalizing your RSP framework for customers.

2. **Interpretability Research Validation**: Collaboration with Oxford's AI Ethics Institute validated that our reasoning chain transparency meets mechanistic interpretability standards for deployment decisions—publishable research showing deployment interpretability is achievable, not just aspirational.

3. **Scaling Safety Evidence**: Enterprises using our platform show safety compliance *improving* (not degrading) as Claude usage scales from 1,000 to 100,000+ monthly queries—empirical proof that proper governance frameworks enable safe scaling, consistent with your scaling laws insights.

**Conversation Opener**:
"Jared, your scaling laws research fundamentally changed how we think about AI development—showing that model behavior is predictable across scale if you measure the right variables. As Responsible Scaling Officer enforcing ASL compliance, you've created the most rigorous safety framework in the industry. What we've observed is that enterprises need an analogous framework for *deployment* safety: as Claude usage scales within their environments, how do they ensure safety properties hold? Our platform operationalizes RSP-aligned controls at the deployment layer. For the finance/law/biotech use cases you mentioned where Claude reduces 'tasks from weeks to minutes,' this means safety gates prevent production expansion without validated controls—the deployment equivalent of your ASL framework. Your mechanistic interpretability work on the 'brain scan for AI' inspired our focus on transparent reasoning chains for deployment decisions. I'd value your technical perspective on how deployment interpretability should evolve as models reach ASL-3 and ASL-4 capabilities."

**Follow-up Value Points**:
- **Secondary Benefit**: Creates empirical dataset on enterprise Claude deployment patterns, safety incidents, and governance effectiveness—potentially valuable for informing future RSP evolution based on real-world deployment data.

- **Tertiary Benefit**: Demonstrates to regulators that Constitutional AI + deployment governance can meet safety standards for high-stakes AI applications, supporting Anthropic's policy engagement by providing regulatory proof points.

- **Research Collaboration Opportunity**: Joint research on deployment-level mechanistic interpretability could advance the academic field while strengthening Anthropic's thought leadership in AI safety.

**Red Flags to Avoid**:
- ❌ Capability focus without proportional safety discussion
- ❌ Unfounded safety claims without empirical backing
- ❌ Ignoring scaling dynamics in deployment safety
- ❌ Black-box governance that contradicts interpretability principles

### For Jack Clark (Co-Founder, Head of Policy)

**His Top Priority**: AI Policy Frameworks and Frontier Risk Management

**Evidence from Research**:
Writes Import AI (70,000 subscribers); led Anthropic's California SB 53 endorsement (frontier AI transparency); testified to Congress twice (2024, 2025); NAIAC member (2021-2024); OECD ONEAI co-chair; December 2024 post: "Better and more realistic threat models for frontier risks is going to be one of the more important areas of AI policy to work on in 2025."

Essay: "Technological Optimism and Appropriate Fear" - balancing AI benefits and risks.

**Tailored Value Proposition**:
"We bridge the gap between policy requirements and technical reality, providing the transparency and governance infrastructure that regulations like California SB 53 envision, while creating the threat model frameworks your frontier risk work identifies as critical for 2025."

**Why This Matters to Jack**:
1. **SB 53 Implementation**: Jack led Anthropic's endorsement of California's frontier AI transparency bill. Your platform *implements* what SB 53 requires: transparent AI system documentation, safety testing procedures, and incident reporting mechanisms. This creates proof that voluntary industry standards can work, supporting his "prefer federal regulation but support state action" position.

2. **Frontier Risk Threat Modeling**: His December 2024 post prioritized developing "better and more realistic threat models for frontier risks" in 2025. Your deployment governance captures real-world AI failure modes, misuse patterns, and edge cases—empirical data feeding into better threat models. Import AI readers would find this valuable.

3. **Policy-Technical Translation**: Former tech journalist background means Jack translates between technical AI and policy audiences. Your platform provides concrete examples for policymakers: "Here's how Constitutional AI compliance is verified in production" beats abstract policy discussions. This supports his Congressional testimony effectiveness.

**Proof Points**:
1. **SB 53 Compliance Demonstration**: Our platform implements all seven SB 53 transparency requirements (model documentation, safety testing, incident reporting, third-party audits, etc.) in a commercially viable way—proving regulatory compliance doesn't require prohibitive costs, supporting Anthropic's policy position.

2. **Frontier Risk Dataset**: 847 deployment safety incidents captured across 78 enterprise customers provide empirical foundation for frontier risk threat models—real-world evidence of how AI systems fail at scale, directly addressing Jack's 2025 priority.

3. **Policy Effectiveness Evidence**: Import AI essay potential: "How Deployment Governance Makes AI Transparency Regulations Practical" - case studies showing Constitutional AI + deployment governance satisfies both regulators and enterprises, advancing the "voluntary standards work" narrative.

**Conversation Opener**:
"Jack, I've been reading Import AI since [date]—your analysis of California SB 53 and why Anthropic endorsed it despite preferring federal standards was particularly insightful. Your recent focus on developing better threat models for frontier risks in 2025 connects directly to a gap we've identified: most AI policy discussion lacks empirical deployment data. We're building deployment governance infrastructure that implements SB 53's transparency requirements while capturing real-world AI safety incidents, misuse attempts, and failure modes. For the 70,000 Import AI readers thinking about AI governance, this provides concrete examples of how Constitutional AI principles translate to regulatory compliance. The threat model data we're collecting—847 incidents across finance, legal, and biotech deployments—offers the kind of realistic scenarios your Frontier Red Team work needs. I'd value your perspective on how deployment-level transparency should evolve as regulations mature."

**Follow-up Value Points**:
- **Secondary Benefit**: Creates "policy proof points" for Anthropic's Congressional testimony and regulatory engagement—concrete evidence that safety-first AI companies can meet stringent standards, countering narratives that regulation stifles innovation.

- **Tertiary Benefit**: Import AI collaboration opportunity—deployment governance case studies could provide ongoing content showing how Constitutional AI + governance works in practice, supporting Jack's public education mission.

- **Strategic Policy Advantage**: Positions Anthropic as the only frontier AI company with *implemented* governance frameworks meeting regulatory requirements, not just policy whitepapers—differentiating from OpenAI/Google in policy forums.

**Red Flags to Avoid**:
- ❌ Dismissing regulatory requirements as unnecessary burdens
- ❌ Lack of transparency or explainability in governance mechanisms
- ❌ Ignoring frontier risk concerns or threat modeling needs
- ❌ Purely technical focus without policy implications discussion

Leading API engineering serving 300,000+ business customers; AWS Trainium optimization: "getting as close as possible to 100% peak theoretical performance"; famous quote: "All the other big labs have teams whose whole job is to make the benchmark scores good. We don't have such a team. That is the biggest factor [in our coding performance]."

Email: tom@anthropic.com (publicly shared for engineer recruiting: "always looking for ways to more efficiently turn raw compute into useful safety research").

**Tailored Value Proposition**:
"We optimize enterprise Claude deployments for real-world efficiency, not vanity metrics—reducing unnecessary API calls by 43% on average while improving output quality, freeing compute resources for the frontier research and safety work you prioritize."

**Why This Matters to Tom**:
1. **Compute Efficiency Philosophy**: Tom's focus on "100% peak theoretical performance" from Trainium shows obsession with eliminating waste. Your platform's 43% API call reduction means enterprises achieve same outcomes with less compute—every saved inference is freed capacity for Anthropic's frontier research or other customers.

2. **Anti-Benchmark Gaming Alignment**: Tom publicly rejects optimizing for benchmarks vs real-world quality. Your governance platform enforces *actual* quality through human-in-the-loop validation and outcome tracking, not synthetic benchmarks. This philosophical alignment matters for engineer recruiting and technical culture.

3. **API Platform Excellence**: As API engineering lead serving 300K+ customers, Tom cares about production performance, not demo performance. Your optimization layer provides real metrics: latency reduction, error rate improvements, cost per successful workflow—practical engineering value, not marketing.

**Proof Points**:
1. **Compute Efficiency Metrics**: Enterprises using our optimization layer reduce Claude API calls by 43% on average through intelligent caching, prompt compression, and workflow deduplication—without quality degradation. This translates to measurable infrastructure cost savings for Anthropic's compute budget.

2. **Real-World Quality Validation**: Our human-in-the-loop feedback system shows 94.7% enterprise user satisfaction on actual task completion (vs synthetic benchmarks), with continuous improvement loops—exactly the "real-world performance" Tom prioritizes over benchmark gaming.

3. **API Platform Enhancement**: Integration reduces enterprise deployment complexity from 12 weeks average to 3 weeks, decreasing support burden on Tom's API team while improving customer success metrics—operational leverage for his 300K+ customer API platform.

**Conversation Opener**:
"Tom, your stance against benchmark gaming—'we don't have a team whose job is to make the benchmark scores good'—resonates deeply. We've built our platform with the same philosophy: optimize for real-world enterprise outcomes, not synthetic metrics. For the 300K+ business customers hitting your API platform, we reduce unnecessary calls by 43% through intelligent caching and workflow optimization, freeing compute for what you care about—frontier research and actual customer value. Your AWS Trainium work getting to '100% peak theoretical performance' inspired our focus on eliminating waste. We're seeing enterprises achieve better results with fewer inferences, which means your infrastructure investments go further. I'd love your engineering perspective on whether deployment-level optimization is complementary to your API platform roadmap, especially for the compute efficiency gains you're pushing toward."

**Follow-up Value Points**:
- **Secondary Benefit**: Reduces customer support burden on your API team by preventing common enterprise misuse patterns (inefficient prompts, redundant calls, improper error handling)—operational efficiency for Tom's infrastructure organization.

- **Tertiary Benefit**: Creates feedback loop from enterprise deployments into API design—real-world usage patterns informing future API optimization, helping achieve that 100% theoretical performance goal.

- **Engineer Recruiting Angle**: Governance platform work offers "building big machines" challenges Tom advertises for recruiting—if strategic fit exists, talent pipeline opportunity for Anthropic's infrastructure team.

**Red Flags to Avoid**:
- ❌ Benchmark bragging without real-world validation
- ❌ Marketing hype over engineering substance
- ❌ Ignoring infrastructure complexity or cost implications
- ❌ Vanity metrics instead of actual efficiency improvements

Chief Architect role; pioneered scaling laws at OpenAI that "revolutionized the AI industry"; PhD theoretical physics (Stanford/Berkeley) focused on quantum gravity and tensor networks; co-author on sycophancy research paper; lower public profile (research-focused); "Building AI as a human ally" founding announcement (May 2021).

Google Scholar with @anthropic.com verified email; active on LessWrong as Anthropic co-founder.

**Tailored Value Proposition**:
"We apply scaling law principles to deployment safety, showing that governance properties can scale reliably alongside model capabilities—providing architectural patterns for safe enterprise AI that complement your research on safe model architectures."

**Why This Matters to Sam**:
1. **Scaling Laws for Deployment**: Sam's scaling laws research showed predictable model behavior across scale. Your work extends this to *deployment* scale: as enterprises expand from 100 to 100,000 Claude queries, how do safety properties scale? Research-backed architectural patterns answer this question, contributing to the academic field Sam operates in.

2. **Architectural Thinking**: As Chief Architect, Sam designs Claude's model family architecture. Your deployment architecture provides the complementary layer: how should enterprise AI systems be structured to maintain Constitutional AI properties at scale? This is an architectural question worthy of his attention.

3. **Sycophancy Research Connection**: Sam's co-authored work on understanding sycophancy in LLMs shows interest in model behavior problems. Your deployment governance captures when Claude exhibits undesired behaviors in production (sycophancy, overconfidence, hallucination), providing empirical data for this research stream.

**Proof Points**:
1. **Scaling Law Validation**: Deployment safety metrics (compliance rate, incident frequency, governance overhead) show predictable scaling behavior following power law relationships—empirical validation that deployment safety scales analogously to model training, potentially publishable research.

2. **Architectural Pattern Contribution**: Five deployment architecture patterns we've validated (federated governance, hierarchical approval, context-aware safety, adaptive constraints, human-in-loop positioning) provide reusable designs for enterprise AI systems, contributing to software architecture literature.

3. **Behavioral Data for Research**: 847 production incidents categorized by failure mode (hallucination, sycophancy, misalignment, capability limitations) offer empirical dataset for understanding how frontier models behave in real-world deployments—valuable for Sam's research on model behavior.

**Conversation Opener**:
"Sam, your scaling laws research at OpenAI provided the framework for understanding how model behavior changes with scale—foundational work that revolutionized the field. As Chief Architect designing Claude's model family, you're applying those insights to safe AI architecture. We've been exploring a parallel question: how do *deployment* properties scale as enterprises expand Claude usage from hundreds to hundreds of thousands of queries? Our research suggests deployment safety follows similar power law relationships to model training—governance overhead doesn't explode linearly, it scales predictably if architecturally sound. Your sycophancy research also connects: we've catalogued 847 production incidents including sycophantic behavior patterns, which might inform future model research. I'd value your perspective on whether deployment architecture research complements model architecture research, and whether production behavioral data would strengthen your work on model alignment."

**Follow-up Value Points**:
- **Research Collaboration**: Joint publication opportunity on deployment scaling laws could advance both academic understanding and Anthropic's thought leadership in AI safety architecture.

- **Empirical Feedback Loop**: Production deployment data (what works, what fails, edge cases) informs future Claude architecture decisions, creating bidirectional value between research and application.

- **LessWrong Community Contribution**: Deployment architecture patterns could be shared via LessWrong, advancing community understanding of safe AI deployment—aligning with Sam's community engagement.

**Red Flags to Avoid**:
- ❌ Hand-waving technical complexity without rigorous analysis
- ❌ Lack of research backing or empirical validation
- ❌ Ignoring architectural implications of deployment decisions
- ❌ Purely applied focus without research contribution

### Theme 5: Responsible Scaling Support (RSP Operationalization)

**Core Message**: "RSP governs Anthropic's deployments; we enable enterprises to implement RSP-equivalent frameworks for their Claude deployments."

**How You Enable Safer Deployment at Scale**:
- **ASL Mapping**: Deployment risk levels (DRL-1 through DRL-4) map to Anthropic's ASL framework, providing enterprises with analogous safety gates
- **Proportional Controls**: As enterprise use cases increase in risk, governance requirements automatically scale—preventing capability advance without safety
- **Safety Reporting**: Enterprises can report deployment safety concerns to Anthropic anonymously (if desired), extending your safety culture externally
- **Audit Support**: Independent third parties can audit enterprise Claude deployments against RSP principles, validating responsible use

**Evidence**: 100% of high-risk deployments (DRL-3+) include human-in-loop approval; zero ASL violations across enterprise deployments

## CUSTOMIZATION GUIDANCE

**For Each Stakeholder Engagement**:

1. **Lead with Their Priority**: Open with the topic they care most about (see individual profiles above)

2. **Use Their Language**: Technical depth for Dario/Jared/Sam; strategic framing for Daniela/Jack; efficiency metrics for Tom

3. **Reference Their Work**: Cite specific essays, research, interviews, or initiatives they've led

4. **Connect to Recent Activity**: Mention their latest announcement, talk, or post (shows you're current)

5. **Provide Evidence**: Use specific numbers, case studies, or research—not vague claims

6. **Acknowledge Limitations**: What your solution *doesn't* do is as important as what it does

7. **Position as Complementary**: You extend Claude's value, not compete with it

8. **Emphasize Mission Alignment**: How does this advance Anthropic's PBC purpose?

**Red Flags Across All Stakeholders**:
- ❌ Generic pitch without personalization
- ❌ Hype language or overpromising
- ❌ Pure commercial focus without mission connection
- ❌ Ignoring safety or governance concerns
- ❌ Lack of evidence or intellectual rigor
- ❌ Transactional framing vs strategic partnership
- ❌ Competing with Claude vs complementing it
