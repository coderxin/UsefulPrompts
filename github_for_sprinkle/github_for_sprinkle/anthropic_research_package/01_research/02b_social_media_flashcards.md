✅ Reference specific content they've created (show you've done homework)
✅ Engage with their ideas, not just promote yours
✅ Be patient - these are busy executives
✅ Use appropriate channel (technical via GitHub, policy via Import AI, etc.)
✅ Respect their focus areas (don't pitch sales to Sam's research posts)

### DON'T:
❌ Spam or over-engage (looks desperate)
❌ Generic LinkedIn connection requests without context
❌ Pitch in social media comments (inappropriate)
❌ Tag them unnecessarily in posts
❌ Ignore their stated interests/priorities
❌ Engage with controversy or flame wars involving them
