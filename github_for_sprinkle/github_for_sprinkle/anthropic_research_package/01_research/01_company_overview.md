## Executive Summary

Anthropic PBC is a frontier AI company building reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems through their proprietary Constitutional AI methodology. Founded in 2021 by former OpenAI researchers Dario and Daniela Amodei, Anthropic has achieved remarkable growth, reaching a $183 billion valuation and $5 billion annual revenue run-rate by September 2025. The company has captured 32% of the enterprise AI market share, surpassing both OpenAI (20%) and Google (20%), driven by their safety-first approach and industry-leading Claude models.

What distinguishes Anthropic is their Public Benefit Corporation structure, which prioritizes humanity's long-term benefit over profit maximization, coupled with their innovative Responsible Scaling Policy that gates deployment on safety validation. Their Claude 4 model achieved 72.5% on the SWE-bench coding benchmark, significantly outperforming GPT-4.1 at 54.6%, while their Constitutional AI approach provides transparent, values-aligned reasoning that resonates with enterprise customers in regulated industries.

With $22+ billion in funding from strategic partners including Amazon ($4B), Google ($2B), and leading venture firms, Anthropic is aggressively expanding globally with new research hubs in Dublin, London, and Zurich, while launching vertical-specific solutions for life sciences and financial services. Their Model Context Protocol (MCP), announced May 2025, positions Claude as a platform with ecosystem potential similar to app stores.
