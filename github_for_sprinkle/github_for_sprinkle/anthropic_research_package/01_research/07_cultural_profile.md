### Communication Examples

**❌ WRONG APPROACH**:
```
"Our revolutionary AI platform is disrupting the [industry] space! We're crushing
benchmarks and seeing explosive growth. This is a limited-time opportunity to get
in on the ground floor of the next unicorn. Our AI is 10x better than anything
out there and will transform your business overnight."
```

**Why This Fails**:
- Hype language ("revolutionary," "disrupting," "crushing," "explosive")
- Vague claims without evidence ("10x better")
- Commercial focus ("next unicorn," "limited-time")
- Overpromising ("transform overnight")
- No acknowledgment of limitations or risks

---

**✅ RIGHT APPROACH**:
```
"We've developed an AI governance platform designed around Constitutional AI
principles. Our approach provides transparent audit trails for AI decisions,
addressing the compliance requirements we've observed in financial services
deployments. In benchmarks with 50 enterprise customers, we've reduced
compliance review time by an average of 37% while maintaining 99.2% accuracy
on regulatory requirement checks.

We acknowledge that our system requires [specific data quality standards] and
may not be suitable for [edge cases]. However, for enterprises deploying Claude
in regulated environments, we provide [specific capability] that complements
Anthropic's model-level safety with deployment-level governance.

We'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how this aligns with your Responsible
Scaling Policy and enterprise expansion goals."
```

**Why This Works**:
- References Constitutional AI (shows research awareness)
- Specific metrics with context (37%, 99.2%, 50 customers)
- Acknowledges limitations honestly
- Frames value in terms of safety and compliance
- Positions as complementary, not competitive
- Respectful, non-pressuring tone
- Connects to their priorities (RSP, enterprise expansion)
