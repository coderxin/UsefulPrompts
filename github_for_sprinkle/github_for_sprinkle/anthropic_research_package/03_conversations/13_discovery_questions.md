## QUESTION PHILOSOPHY FOR ANTHROPIC

**Anthropic's Culture**: They value intellectual curiosity, thoughtful inquiry, and substantive conversations over transactional discovery. Questions should demonstrate:

1. **You've Done Homework**: Reference specific research, recent initiatives, published work
2. **You're Thinking Deeply**: Not surface-level qualifying, but genuinely exploring challenges
3. **You Genuinely Want to Learn**: Curiosity about their mission, not just qualifying them as a buyer
4. **You Understand Their Mission**: Safety, alignment, Constitutional AI, societal benefit

**Question Framework**: SPIN adapted for Anthropic
- **Situation**: Understand current state (but show you already know basics from research)
- **Problem**: Uncover challenges (frame as opportunities, not weaknesses)
- **Implication**: Explore consequences (long-term, societal, not just quarterly business)
- **Need-Payoff**: Co-discover value (collaborative exploration, not pitching disguised as questions)

## STRATEGIC QUESTIONS (Demonstrate Research - 30+)

**Purpose**: Show you've done homework, create rapport, open strategic conversation

---

### For Dario Amodei (CEO & Co-Founder)

**Q1**: "Dario, I've been following your 'Machines of Loving Grace' essay with great interest—particularly your vision for AI accelerating scientific discovery while maintaining safety. As Constitutional AI evolves toward handling AGI-level capabilities, what do you see as the hardest remaining alignment challenge at that scale?"

**Why this works**:
- References his specific published work (shows deep research)
- Demonstrates understanding of Constitutional AI trajectory
- Asks about frontier thinking (engages his role as research leader)
- Long-term framing (aligns with PBC's decades thinking)

**What you learn**:
- His current research priorities and focus areas
- Where he sees capability vs alignment gaps
- Potential collaboration areas around scaling alignment
- Timeline thinking for AGI-level safety challenges

**How to pivot to your value**:
"That scaling challenge you mentioned—ensuring safety properties hold as capabilities increase—connects to what we're seeing at deployment level. Enterprises deploying Claude face a similar challenge: as they scale from 100 queries to 100,000 queries across more complex use cases, how do safety controls scale without becoming bottlenecks? We've found deployment safety follows similar power law behavior to model training, which might inform your ASL framework evolution..."

---

**Q2**: "Your 'Urgency of Interpretability' essay emphasizes understanding AI decision-making as critical for safety. At the deployment layer—where Claude's outputs are used in FDA medical decisions or SEC trading algorithms—what level of interpretability do you think regulators should require beyond model-level transparency?"

**Why this works**:
- Cites his specific essay and research priority
- Extends model interpretability to deployment context (where you add value)
- Invites his expertise on regulatory requirements
- Connects to real-world applications (FDA, SEC)

**What you learn**:
- His thinking on deployment vs model interpretability
- How he views regulatory requirements evolving
- Whether he sees deployment governance as Anthropic's responsibility or ecosystem's
- Gaps between current Constitutional AI capabilities and regulatory needs

**How to pivot to your value**:
"The gap you identified between model interpretability and regulatory requirements is exactly what we're working on. Constitutional AI provides transparent reasoning chains—'Claude recommended X because of principles Y and Z.' What regulators need is the next layer: 'Those principles satisfy FDA requirement 21 CFR Part 11 section A, and here's the full audit trail.' We're building that deployment-level interpretability infrastructure for enterprises using Claude in regulated contexts..."

---

**Q3**: "Given Anthropic's rapid growth from $87M to $5B run-rate in 18 months, how do you balance scaling commercially while maintaining the safety rigor and Constitutional AI quality that defines your approach?"

**Why this works**:
- Shows awareness of business metrics (not just research)
- Frames growth as positive but acknowledges potential tension
- Respectfully asks about a challenge he's actively managing
- Demonstrates understanding of quality vs growth tradeoffs

**What you learn**:
- How he thinks about commercial vs safety priorities
- What mechanisms ensure quality at scale
- Whether Applied AI team capacity is a constraint
- His view on ecosystem partners vs building everything in-house

**How to pivot to your value**:
"That balance you mentioned—scaling commercially without compromising Constitutional AI quality—is where we might fit. As enterprise customers multiply, Applied AI team can't custom-build compliance infrastructure for every deployment. We've productized Constitutional AI governance frameworks for FDA and SEC contexts, so each AI engineer supports 15 enterprise deployments instead of 4. Essentially, we're a scaling lever that preserves quality by embedding Constitutional AI principles into reusable infrastructure..."

---

### For Daniela Amodei (President & Co-Founder)

**Q4**: "Daniela, your work scaling Anthropic from founding team to 1,000+ employees while maintaining PBC mission is remarkable. In your Stanford ETL talk, you emphasized preserving mission alignment during hypergrowth. As you triple the international workforce, what specific governance mechanisms ensure the Long-Term Benefit Trust remains effective?"

**Why this works**:
- References her specific speaking engagement (shows you've watched/read)
- Acknowledges her operational leadership achievements
- Asks about governance (her area of expertise and focus)
- Shows understanding of PBC structure and Long-Term Benefit Trust

**What you learn**:
- How she thinks about culture and mission at scale
- What governance processes matter most to her
- Whether partnerships need LTB review (decision authority)
- Her view on mission-aligned vs transactional relationships

**How to pivot to your value**:
"The mission alignment governance you described—ensuring Constitutional AI principles are maintained even as the organization scales—mirrors what enterprises need when deploying Claude. They want Constitutional AI's safety properties, but as deployments scale across hundreds of employees in regulated contexts, how do they ensure those principles are actually followed, not just acknowledged? We provide deployment-level governance that embeds Constitutional AI into workflows, essentially extending your mission alignment thinking to enterprise customer environments..."

---

**Q5**: "You led partnerships with Google ($2B + TPU access) and Amazon ($4B). When evaluating strategic partners versus vendor relationships, what criteria distinguish between the two for Anthropic?"

**Why this works**:
- References her successful partnership track record
- Asks her to define criteria (not you guessing)
- Shows understanding that Anthropic is selective about partnerships
- Respectful of her strategic thinking

**What you learn**:
- Partnership criteria and evaluation process
- What "strategic alignment" means in practice
- Whether your offering fits partnership or vendor category
- Decision-making timeline and stakeholders

**How to pivot to your value**:
"Based on those partnership criteria you outlined—long-term alignment, infrastructure they'd build anyway, mutual success incentives—here's how we think about Anthropic relationship: We only succeed if Constitutional AI becomes the standard for regulated industries. That's why we've turned down revenue from companies wanting governance for non-Constitutional AI models. Our incentives align: every successful Claude deployment in FDA or SEC contexts strengthens Constitutional AI's moat and your 32% enterprise market share. That feels more like the Google/Amazon partnership model than transactional vendor relationship..."

---

**Q6**: "As you expand the Applied AI team 5x, what's the current ratio of AI engineers to enterprise deployments, and what would you like it to be?"

**Why this works**:
- References recent expansion announcement (current awareness)
- Asks for metrics (data-driven discussion she values)
- Identifies potential constraint (team capacity)
- Positions you as potentially helping achieve her target

**What you learn**:
- Current operational metrics and efficiency
- Whether capacity is a constraint or scaling smoothly
- What aspects of enterprise deployment are most resource-intensive
- Her target operating model

**How to pivot to your value**:
"That leverage target you mentioned—getting from 4 deployments per engineer to 10-15—is exactly where pre-validated Constitutional AI governance infrastructure helps. Right now, each enterprise deployment likely requires custom compliance work: researching FDA or SEC requirements, building audit frameworks, achieving regulatory approval. If that infrastructure is pre-built and Constitutional AI principles are already mapped to regulatory requirements, your AI engineers focus on the AI application, not governance plumbing. We've seen that shift the ratio from 4 to 15..."

### For Jared Kaplan (Chief Science Officer & Responsible Scaling Officer)

**Q7**: "Jared, your role as Responsible Scaling Officer is unique in the AI industry—creating actual accountability for safety commitments. How do you operationalize the Responsible Scaling Policy at frontier model scale, particularly the ASL transition gates?"

**Why this works**:
- Acknowledges his unique role and its importance
- Asks about practical implementation (not just theory)
- Shows understanding of ASL framework
- Respectful of the complexity he's managing

**What you learn**:
- How RSP works in practice, not just in documentation
- What ASL transitions are most challenging
- Whether deployment safety (beyond model training) is in RSP scope
- What data or evidence informs ASL assessments

**How to pivot to your value**:
"The ASL framework you described for governing Anthropic's model deployments is exactly what enterprises need for governing *their* Claude deployments. We've built Deployment Risk Levels—DRL-1 through DRL-4—that map to your ASL framework. Each DRL has corresponding safety controls: automated Constitutional AI validation for DRL-1/2, human-in-loop for DRL-3, multi-party approval for DRL-4. Essentially, we're extending RSP thinking from Anthropic's deployments to enterprise environments where Claude is used in regulated contexts..."

---

**Q8**: "Your scaling laws research at OpenAI revolutionized how we think about model behavior across scale. Do you see analogous scaling laws for *deployment* safety—how governance properties behave as enterprise usage scales from thousands to millions of queries?"

**Why this works**:
- References his pioneering research (shows technical credibility)
- Extends his thinking to new domain (deployment vs training)
- Frames as intellectual question, not sales pitch
- Positions you as thinking about similar problems

**What you learn**:
- Whether he's thought about deployment scaling laws
- His view on governance overhead and efficiency
- Whether this is research area Anthropic might pursue
- Potential collaboration opportunities

**How to pivot to your value**:
"Your question about deployment scaling laws is exactly what we've researched with Oxford AI Ethics. We found safety compliance actually *improves* as deployment scales—from 97% at 100K queries to 99.4% at 10M queries—because the ML-based risk classifier gets better with data. This follows power law behavior similar to model training. We're preparing a paper on this; if you're interested, we'd love your feedback since your scaling laws work provided the foundation for this thinking..."

---

**Q9**: "You mentioned in your TechCrunch Sessions AI talk that Claude 3.7 is reducing finance and law tasks from 'weeks to minutes.' As those high-stakes deployments scale, how do you think about the tradeoff between deployment velocity and safety validation?"

**Why this works**:
- References specific talk he gave (recent awareness)
- Focuses on deployment context (where you add value)
- Asks about tradeoff he's actively managing
- Respects the tension between capability and safety

**What you learn**:
- How he thinks about deployment speed vs safety
- Whether enterprises are pressuring for faster deployment
- What safety validation is required before production use
- His view on where safety responsibility lies (Anthropic vs enterprise)

**How to pivot to your value**:
"That tradeoff you mentioned—deployment velocity vs safety validation—is exactly where intelligent governance architecture helps. Instead of reviewing every inference (slow) or reviewing nothing (risky), we route by risk level. 82% of queries are low-risk, validated automatically in <10ms. Only 2.3% trigger human review. This gives both velocity *and* safety validation. For the finance/law deployments you mentioned, this means Claude can reduce tasks from weeks to minutes while maintaining the safety rigor your RSP framework requires..."

### For Jack Clark (Co-Founder, Head of Policy)

**Q10**: "Jack, I've been reading Import AI religiously—your analysis of California SB 53 and why Anthropic endorsed it despite preferring federal standards was particularly insightful. As AI regulation evolves globally, how do you see the landscape playing out over the next 18-24 months?"

**Why this works**:
- Shows you read his newsletter (genuine engagement, not just LinkedIn stalking)
- References specific policy position he championed
- Asks for forward-looking analysis (his expertise area)
- Demonstrates understanding of regulatory complexity

**What you learn**:
- His view on regulatory timeline and evolution
- What regulations will impact enterprise Claude deployments
- Whether Anthropic is working with regulators proactively
- Opportunities to support policy objectives

**How to pivot to your value**:
"The regulatory landscape you outlined—SB 53 in California, EU AI Act, potential federal frameworks—all create demand for what we're building: infrastructure that proves Constitutional AI satisfies regulatory requirements. We've validated frameworks for FDA 21 CFR Part 11, SEC SR 11-7, GDPR Article 22. These provide proof points for your policy engagement: 'Constitutional AI + deployment governance can meet stringent transparency requirements.' Every successful regulatory approval strengthens your 'voluntary industry standards work' narrative..."

---

**Q11**: "In your December 2024 post, you said 'better and more realistic threat models for frontier risks is going to be one of the more important areas of AI policy to work on in 2025.' Are you capturing deployment-level safety incidents from enterprise customers, or is that data mostly siloed?"

**Why this works**:
- Quotes his recent post precisely (shows close attention)
- Connects to his stated 2025 priority
- Offers potential value (data you're collecting)
- Non-pitchy framing (just asking about data availability)

**What you learn**:
- Whether Anthropic systematically collects deployment incident data
- How they think about enterprise vs Anthropic-direct deployment safety
- Whether threat model research is active area of focus
- Potential research collaboration opportunities

**How to pivot to your value**:
"The deployment-level threat model data you mentioned as a priority—we're generating that empirically. 847 production safety incidents across 78 enterprise customers: Claude hallucinations in clinical contexts, sycophancy in financial analysis, capability limitations in regulatory submissions. We've categorized by failure mode, risk level, and outcome. This real-world dataset provides foundation for better threat models—way more realistic than red team exercises. If valuable for your Frontier Red Team work, happy to share the anonymized dataset for research purposes..."

---

**Q12**: "Your testimony to Congress emphasized the need for AI safety standards that don't stifle innovation. What specific examples would you point to as 'good regulation' that balances both goals?"

**Why this works**:
- References his Congressional testimony (high-profile engagement)
- Asks him to define "good regulation" (invites his expertise)
- Shows understanding of the innovation vs safety tension
- Positions you to align with his examples

**What you learn**:
- What regulatory approaches he endorses
- How he distinguishes good vs bad regulation
- What frameworks Anthropic would support
- How to position your offering in regulatory-friendly way

**How to pivot to your value**:
"The 'good regulation' examples you cited—outcome-focused, not prescriptive—align with how we've built Constitutional AI governance frameworks. Instead of 'you must review every AI decision manually' (prescriptive, kills innovation), frameworks say 'you must prove AI decisions are explainable and aligned with safety principles' (outcome-focused). Constitutional AI satisfies that through transparent reasoning chains; we provide the deployment documentation proving it. This regulatory approach enables innovation while ensuring safety..."

---

### For Tom Brown (Co-Founder, Chief Compute Officer)

**Q13**: "Tom, your work with AWS on Trainium optimization—'getting as close as possible to 100% peak theoretical performance'—is fascinating. How do you think about governance overhead from an infrastructure efficiency perspective?"

**Why this works**:
- References his specific AWS/Trainium work (recent and public)
- Quotes him directly (shows attention to his priorities)
- Asks about efficiency (his focus area)
- Technical framing (matches his communication style)

**What you learn**:
- How he thinks about governance overhead and latency
- Whether infrastructure efficiency extends to deployment layer
- His tolerance for latency/overhead in enterprise deployments
- Technical benchmarks he cares about

**How to pivot to your value**:
"That zero-overhead philosophy you're driving toward with Trainium applies to governance architecture too. We've optimized for constant O(1) governance overhead as deployment scales—82% of queries validated in <10ms, weighted average latency 12ms across 12.4M API calls. Unlike centralized governance that creates bottlenecks, federated architecture scales horizontally. For the 300,000+ business customers hitting your API platform, this means governance doesn't slow down Claude performance..."

---

**Q14**: "I love your stance on anti-benchmark gaming: 'We don't have a team whose job is to make the benchmark scores good.' How does that philosophy extend to enterprise AI deployment quality measurement?"

**Why this works**:
- References his famous quote (shows you've researched him specifically)
- Acknowledges his principled stance (values alignment)
- Asks how principle applies beyond model development
- Invites him to define quality metrics

**What you learn**:
- What quality metrics matter for enterprise deployments
- How he thinks about measuring real-world vs synthetic performance
- Whether customer satisfaction vs benchmarks drives decisions
- His view on governance adding value vs overhead

**How to pivot to your value**:
"Your anti-benchmark-gaming philosophy is exactly how we measure governance effectiveness: real-world regulatory audit pass rates, not synthetic compliance scores. 23 FDA audits, 31 SEC audits, 100% pass rate—those are adversarial evaluators whose job is to find problems, not benchmarks we can optimize. The quality metric we track is: do enterprises actually get Claude approved for production deployment in regulated contexts? That's the real-world outcome that matters, not a compliance dashboard score..."

---

### For Sam McCandlish (Co-Founder, Chief Architect)

**Q15**: "Sam, your scaling laws research showed that model behavior is predictable across scale if you measure the right variables. Do you think deployment properties—like safety compliance or governance overhead—follow similar scaling laws as model training?"

- Extends his thinking to new domain (deployment vs training)
- Intellectually engaging question for research-focused leader
- Invites collaboration on research topic

**What you learn**:
- Whether he's thought about deployment scaling dynamics
- His view on governance research as legitimate area of study
- Potential interest in joint research or validation
- How he thinks about architecture beyond model development

**How to pivot to your value**:
"The scaling laws question you raised is what we're researching with Oxford AI Ethics. We're finding deployment safety *does* follow power law behavior—safety compliance improves from 97% to 99.4% as usage scales 100x, because the risk classifier gets better with data. Governance overhead stays constant O(1), not linear bloat. We're preparing a paper on this; your scaling laws work provides the theoretical foundation. If interesting, we'd value your technical perspective on the architecture..."

---

**Q16**: "Your research on sycophancy in LLMs identified an important alignment challenge. At deployment level, do you see sycophantic behavior as context-dependent—like, Claude might be sycophantic in certain regulatory or corporate environments even if the model isn't inherently sycophantic?"

**Why this works**:
- References his specific research area (sycophancy paper)
- Extends to deployment context (where behaviors might emerge)
- Shows understanding of technical nuance
- Frames as research question, not pitch

**What you learn**:
- How he thinks about context-dependent model behaviors
- Whether deployment environment affects model outputs
- Potential collaboration on sycophancy research
- His interest in real-world behavioral data

**How to pivot to your value**:
"The context-dependent sycophancy you mentioned is exactly what we're seeing in production data. Example: Claude in financial contexts sometimes exhibits sycophancy when analysts have strong priors, even though the model isn't systemically sycophantic. We've catalogued 124 instances across 31 financial customers. This real-world deployment data might inform your model-level sycophancy research—showing how deployment context affects behaviors the model training didn't anticipate. Happy to share the dataset if valuable for your research..."

**Why this works**:
- Honest framing (not competitive fishing)
- Asks about failures/losses (shows humility)
- Identifies barriers (opportunities to remove)
- Respectful disclaimer

**Listen For**:
- "Compliance timeline too long" → acceleration opportunity
- "Integration complexity" → deployment infrastructure gap
- "Lack of regulatory validation" → proof points needed
- "Pricing" → different problem, might not be your fit
- "They don't abandon often" → strong product-market fit

---

**Q34**: "For the Life Sciences and Financial Services solutions you launched in October, what customer feedback have you received about what's working vs what still needs development?"

**Why this works**:
- References recent launch (current awareness)
- Asks for customer feedback (values customer voice)
- Balanced (working *and* needs development)
- Positions you to potentially address gaps

**Listen For**:
- "Love the capabilities but need compliance infrastructure" → clear gap
- "Audit trails for regulatory submission" → specific need
- "Integration with existing workflows" → deployment complexity
- "Training on Constitutional AI application" → education need

## QUESTION SEQUENCING FRAMEWORKS

### The Funnel (Broad → Narrow)

**Stage 1 - Industry Level** (Broad context):
"What's changing in enterprise AI adoption patterns across regulated industries?"

**Stage 2 - Company Level** (Anthropic specific):
"How is that trend affecting Anthropic's Life Sciences and Financial Services expansion?"

**Stage 3 - Role Level** (Their responsibilities):
"Where does that trend show up in your Applied AI team's deployment work?"

**Stage 4 - Challenge Level** (Specific pain):
"What's the hardest part of addressing that deployment challenge?"

**Stage 5 - Solution Level** (Co-discovery):
"What would an ideal solution to that challenge look like?"

**Why this works**: Starts broad (comfortable), narrows to specific pain, ends with them defining solution criteria (which you can then map to your offering)

---

### The Ladder (Tactical → Strategic)

**Rung 1 - Tactical** (Day-to-day operations):
"How are enterprise customers currently handling Claude deployments in FDA contexts?"

**Rung 2 - Operational** (Systems/process):
"What systemic challenges does that create for your Applied AI team?"

**Rung 3 - Strategic** (Business priorities):
"How does that deployment friction affect your 2025 growth priorities?"

**Rung 4 - Vision** (Long-term):
"Where does enterprise deployment infrastructure need to be in 2-3 years to support your vision?"

**Why this works**: Moves from concrete (easy to answer) to abstract (strategic thinking), building rapport and understanding throughout

---

### The Bowtie (Specific → Expand → Narrow)

**Point 1 - Specific** (Concrete starting point):
"I noticed your MCP announcement in May—really smart platform play."

**Point 2 - Expand** (Broader context):
"How does MCP fit into your broader ecosystem strategy for Claude?"

**Point 3 - Strategic** (Big picture):
"What does 'winning' in the enterprise AI platform race look like for Anthropic?"

**Point 4 - Narrow Back** (Specific challenge):
"What's the biggest barrier to that platform vision today?"

**Point 5 - Co-Discovery** (Solution exploration):
"What capabilities or infrastructure would help unlock that vision?"

**Why this works**: Creates intellectual engagement (broad thinking) while identifying specific opportunities

## ACTIVE LISTENING TECHNIQUES FOR ANTHROPIC

### Listen for Specific Signals

**Priority Indicators**:
- "We're really focused on..." → Current top priority
- "We've been thinking about..." → Emerging priority, exploring phase
- "We're struggling with..." → Pain point, ready for solution
- "Long-term, we want..." → Strategic vision, patient capital opportunity

**Decision Authority Indicators**:
- "I would need to..." → Individual authority level
- "We would need to..." → Team decision, identify team members
- "That would require..." → External authority, identify who
- "The board/LTB would..." → Governance review needed

**Timeline Indicators**:
- "Right now..." → Immediate priority, fast timeline
- "This quarter/year..." → Near-term, active evaluation
- "Eventually..." → Someday/maybe, stay connected but not urgent
- "We're planning for 2026..." → Long-term, patient relationship building

### Question Techniques for Anthropic Culture

**The Echo** (Simple but powerful for Anthropic's thoughtful culture):

Them: "We're seeing challenges with regulatory approval timelines."

You: "Regulatory approval timelines? Tell me more about that."

**Why it works**: Shows active listening, encourages elaboration, respects their expertise

---

**The Boomerang** (Qualify before answering):

Them: "How does your governance platform handle multi-region GDPR compliance?"

You: "Great question—before I answer specifically, which regions matter most for your current enterprise deployments? EU primarily, or broader international?"

**Why it works**: Qualifies their need, gives more targeted answer, shows thoughtfulness

---

**The Columbo** (Callback to earlier comment):

You: "Just one more thing I'm curious about—you mentioned earlier that Constitutional AI transparency appeals to compliance teams. How do those compliance teams typically validate that transparency in practice today?"

**Why it works**: Shows you were actively listening throughout, connects threads, Anthropic values intellectual rigor

---

**The Reflection** (Summarize to confirm understanding):

You: "Let me make sure I understand correctly: the challenge is that enterprises love Constitutional AI's model-level transparency, but they're struggling to translate that to the deployment-level audit trails that FDA or SEC regulators require. Is that accurate?"

**Why it works**: Confirms understanding before pitching, shows respect for precision, Anthropic values intellectual honesty

## QUESTIONS TO AVOID (❌ Red Flags)

### Lazy Questions (Show No Research)

- ❌ "So what does Anthropic do?" (You should already know this)
- ❌ "What are your strategic priorities?" (Publicly documented)
- ❌ "How many customers do you have?" (Public metrics: 300,000+)
- ❌ "What's Claude?" (Seriously, do basic research)

**Why harmful**: Signals you haven't done homework, disrespects their time, damages credibility immediately

---

### Leading Questions (Too Salesy)

- ❌ "Don't you think AI governance is critical for enterprise adoption?" (Obviously leading)
- ❌ "Wouldn't it be great if enterprises could deploy Claude faster?" (Of course they'd say yes)
- ❌ "How much would you pay for faster regulatory approval?" (Premature, transactional)

**Why harmful**: Feels manipulative, Anthropic values authentic inquiry not sales tactics

---

### Inappropriate Questions (Cultural Misfit)

- ❌ "When can we close this deal?" (Rushing, transactional, misaligned)
- ❌ "What's your budget for governance solutions?" (Too direct, too early)
- ❌ "Can you introduce me to [specific decision-maker]?" (Using them for access before value)
- ❌ "How can we beat OpenAI together?" (Combative, not Anthropic's style)

**Why harmful**: Misreads Anthropic culture (thoughtful, mission-driven, long-term, not transactional)

---

### Closed Questions (Dead Ends)

- ❌ "Do you use AI governance tools?" (Yes/no, conversation killer)
- ❌ "Is safety important to you?" (Obviously yes, wastes time)
- ❌ "Are you happy with current deployment processes?" (Too generic)

**Why harmful**: Doesn't create dialogue, misses opportunity for discovery, signals lack of preparation

---

## QUESTION QUALITY CHECKLIST

**Before asking, verify**:

- [ ] Does this demonstrate research and preparation? (Not generic discovery)
- [ ] Is it open-ended, inviting substantive response? (Not yes/no)
- [ ] Does it align with Anthropic's values? (Safety, rigor, long-term thinking)
- [ ] Will the answer provide valuable information? (Not just politeness)
- [ ] Does it respect their expertise and time? (Not wasting with obvious questions)
- [ ] Am I genuinely curious about the answer? (Not just going through motions)
- [ ] Could this lead to collaborative problem-solving? (Not just qualifying them)

**If you can't check all boxes, refine the question or don't ask it.**
